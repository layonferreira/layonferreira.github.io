Hi, My name is Layon Ferreira, I'm from Brazil but I have lived most of my life in Portugal.
I'm Living in London since January 2015, and I Intend to live here for the foreseeable future.
I'm a Full Stack Web developer, specialised on Ruby on Rails and React.
Although I have learned the base of programming in a course with a really long name "Information Systems Management and Programming Technician, Computer Programming",
most of my knowledge comes from self-learning and curiosity.
